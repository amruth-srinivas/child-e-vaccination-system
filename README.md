# child-e-vaccination-system

The proposed project is a smart child health care system that provides children or any
user an easy way of booking a doctor’s appointment. This is a web based application that
overcomes the issue of managing and booking appointments according to user’s choice or
demands. The task sometimes becomes very tedious for the compounder or doctor himself in
manually allotting appointments for the users as per their availability. Hence this project
offers an effective solution where users can view various booking slots available and select
the preferred date and time. The already booked space will be marked red and will not be
available for anyone else for the specified time. This system also allows users to cancel their
booking anytime
